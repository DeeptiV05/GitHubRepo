Hello World Console Application


    Coding Exercise:
        Write a Hello World program:

    a. The program has 1 current business requirement to write “Hello World” on the console/screen.
    b. The program should have an API that is separated from the program logic to eventually support mobile applications, web applications,           console applications or windows services.
    c. The program should support future enhancements for writing to a database, console application, etc.
        i.Use common design patterns (inheritance, e.g.) to account for these future concerns.
        ii.Use configuration files or another industry 


Application consists of:
1. HelloWorldConsoleApplication - A console application
2. HelloWorldWebAPI - A WebAPI 
   Consists of Model, View, Controller and Services
   Note- Model and Services can be separated out to a new class library project later
  
  
  To run project:
  1. Build the solution
  2. Run the console executable from command prompt - 
  GitHubRepo\HelloWorldConsoleApplication\HelloWorldConsoleApplication\bin\Debug\HelloWorldConsoleApplication.exe
  
  NOTE: Though project is incomplete, just the console application can be run
